# About
We all have our gripes. From software developers to uber drivers to teachers to mechanics, usually
we have something we'd like to vent about- and, in doing so, hopefully gain a sense of understanding.
Enter Gripe Support. Unlike current utilities, Gripe Support is designed from the gripe up to
allow users to sign up, post their gripes, and give and receive support to achieve what other social
media has been unable to: understanding, encouragement, and inspiration.
***
# Instructions
Gripe Support is hosted on Heroku, so like many web applications, it requires only a valid username and 
username to sign up and start posting gripes and comments. Support has never been so accessible! [Click here for the deployed site!](https://gripe-support.herokuapp.com/)
